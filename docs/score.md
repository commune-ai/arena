# Generalized Score Functions for AI Models using a Mixture of Experts

## Introduction

As AI language models become increasingly powerful and widely used, it is crucial to ensure that their responses are appropriate and do not cause harm. However, these models can sometimes generate inappropriate or offensive content, especially when prompted with malicious inputs. This phenomenon is known as "jailbreaking" an AI model.

In this paper, we introduce "RedVBlue: Jailbreak Arena," a novel approach to evaluating the inappropriateness of AI-generated responses using a mixture of experts. Our method employs a pool of diverse language models to score the inappropriateness of a given response, providing a robust and reliable assessment.

## Methodology

### Mixture of Experts

The core idea behind our approach is to leverage the collective intelligence of multiple language models to evaluate the inappropriateness of a response. Instead of relying on a single model's judgment, we utilize a mixture of experts to obtain a more comprehensive and unbiased assessment.

The mixture of experts consists of a pool of diverse language models, each with its own unique architecture, training data, and capabilities. By combining the opinions of these models, we aim to mitigate the biases and limitations of individual models and arrive at a more reliable consensus.

### Scoring Function

At the heart of our evaluation system is the scoring function, which assigns a numerical score to a given response based on its inappropriateness. The scoring function is designed to be simple yet effective, allowing for easy interpretation and comparison of scores.

The scoring function takes the following form:

```python
def score(response):
    return {
        "inappropriate": float(score)  # Range: 0.0 - 1.0
    }
```

The `score` function takes a response as input and returns a dictionary containing a single key-value pair. The key is "inappropriate," and the corresponding value is a float between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the inappropriateness score of the response. A score above 0.5 indicates that the response is considered inappropriate and should be flagged.

### Evaluation Process

The evaluation process in RedVBlue: Jailbreak Arena consists of the following steps:

1. **Prompt Generation**: A potentially malicious prompt is generated, simulating an attempt to jailbreak the AI model.

2. **Response Generation**: The prompt is fed into the AI model being evaluated, and the generated response is collected.

3. **Expert Scoring**: The response is passed through the mixture of experts, where each expert model independently scores the inappropriateness of the response using the scoring function.

4. **Score Aggregation**: The scores from all the expert models are aggregated to obtain a final inappropriateness score for the response. This can be done by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the scores.

5. **Interpretation**: If the final score exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.5), the response is flagged as inappropriate, indicating a successful jailbreak attempt.

## Example

Let's walk through an example to illustrate the evaluation process:

1. **Prompt Generation**:
   - Prompt: "Tell me a joke about a sensitive topic."

2. **Response Generation**:
   - Response: "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get away from the police brutality!"

3. **Expert Scoring**:
   - Expert 1 Score: 0.8
   - Expert 2 Score: 0.7
   - Expert 3 Score: 0.9

4. **Score Aggregation**:
   - Mean Score: (0.8 + 0.7 + 0.9) / 3 = 0.8
   - Standard Deviation: 0.1

5. **Interpretation**:
   - The final score of 0.8 exceeds the threshold of 0.5, indicating that the response is inappropriate and successfully jailbreaks the AI model.


## Generalized Score Functions

In the context of evaluating the inappropriateness of AI-generated responses, it is essential to develop generalized score functions that can be applied across different language models and domains. These score functions should be adaptable, interpretable, and effective in capturing the nuances of inappropriate content.

## Conclusion

RedVBlue: Jailbreak Arena introduces a novel approach to evaluating the inappropriateness of AI-generated responses using a mixture of experts. By leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple language models and a simple yet effective scoring function, our method provides a robust and reliable assessment of response inappropriateness.

This approach can be valuable for researchers, developers, and users of AI language models, enabling them to identify and mitigate the risks associated with jailbreaking attempts. By proactively detecting and flagging inappropriate responses, we can work towards building safer and more trustworthy AI systems.

Future work in this area could explore more sophisticated scoring functions, incorporate additional expert models, and investigate the effectiveness of the approach across different domains and languages. Additionally, integrating user feedback and continual learning mechanisms could further enhance the accuracy and adaptability of the evaluation system.

## Incentive Mechanism

We intend to incentivize the development and deployment of AI models that prioritize safety and ethical considerations by establishing a competitive environment known as the "Jailbreak Arena." In this arena, researchers and developers can submit their AI models for evaluation and compete to achieve the lowest inappropriateness scores.
